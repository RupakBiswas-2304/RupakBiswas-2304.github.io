**Description:** The purpose is to give developers and testers a platform for learning how to test applications and code securely. PyGoat is written in python and uses the Django web framework as a platform. It also has web application vulnerabilities (such as XSS and SQLi). PyGoat also provides a section where you may view the source code, identify the error that led to the vulnerability, and make adjustments to secure it. It provides a free platform for improving common coding mistakes and guides toward secure coding.
